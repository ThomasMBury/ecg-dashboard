## Background
With modern wearable devices such as the [Icentia CardioSTAT](https://www.cardiostat.com/), patients can seamlessly record a continuous, multi-day ECG recording as they go about their daily lives. With a sample rate of 250Hz, a 2-week recording consists of over 300 million datapoints. With a large cohort of patients to analyse, this becomes an unprecedented amount of data. Dashboards provide an excellent way to interactively view and analyse large datasets. Here, we have created a dashboard using [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to analyse these long ECG recordings. We showcase it here, with patient data from the [Icentia11k](https://physionet.org/content/icentia11k-continuous-ecg/1.0/) database.
